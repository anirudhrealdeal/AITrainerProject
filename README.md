# AITrainerProject
This is your own AI Personal trainer which counts the perfect bicep curls you perform so that you don't get to keep a count of those half bicep curls which you perform when you get tired. I used mediapipe and opencv-python. Also shows the percentage of completion of a bicep curl. Check README for the output.
